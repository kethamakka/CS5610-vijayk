    <h2>Thinking on a bigger scale</h2>
    <p>The sole purpose of this project is to put the technologies that i learnt during this course to test. This project is very generic in terms of applying it to a particular business. The usage of web APIs and integrating their data in a website, opens up a whole new world of options. Any business can find the most important data end points and integrate them all in a single page.</p>
    <p>An application using this design pattern, on a bigger scale would be like this</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The page holds everything important that a general user needs fro the moment he wakes up till he goes back to bed.</li>
        <li>It might contain news feed apps, that feed the widget with RSS feeds</li>
        <li>Would contain apps to look up places like yelp, road trip helper and more.</li>
        <li>Might contain recreational apps like music and videos.</li>
        <li>Useful widgets like image galleries, camera, mahematical widgets, alarm clock and more</li>
        <li>All the quentissential needs could be met with a single account.</li>
    </ul>
