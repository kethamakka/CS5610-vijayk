            <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>

            <h3>About the Experiment</h3>
            <p>The Experiment is about responsive container. The css of the webpage uses the "@media" tag which refers to the screen of the display device. If the display device has a width grater then 700px, the ".pad" class of the body will have a fixed width of text in it, i.e 600px.If the minimizing of the window reaches its next break point, that is 500px - 700px, the text will now be confined to a size of 400px. This is to make sure that the contaoner of the body will always be responsive.</p>
