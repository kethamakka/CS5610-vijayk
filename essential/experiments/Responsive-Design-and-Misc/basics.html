            <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>

            <h3>About the Experiment</h3>
            <p>The Experiment is about responsive dessign. The css of the webpage uses the "@media" tag which refers to the screen of the display device. If the display device has a width grater then 700px, the body of the page will have cornflower blue and the div tag of "pad" class will have beige color and background.<br /> If the user strts to minimize the window and the width changes to some width between 500px and 699px, the BG color changes to cadetblue. If the window is less than or equal to 500px, the background color changes to aqua.<br />The h3 Tags are used as subheadings. so all h3 tags are with cadetblue background </p>
