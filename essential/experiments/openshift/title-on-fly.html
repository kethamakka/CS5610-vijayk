    <h3>About the experiment</h3>
    <p>The title of the tile when the tile is initially added would be "pick a category for this tile". Once the user selects the category for a tile from the manu, The titile gets rendered specific to the selected widget. This is done by emptying the title and appending the new title to the source of the event.</p>
