            <h3>About the Experiment</h3>
            <p>This experiment is about the grid management in bootstrap. The bootstrap defines a webpage in to 12 columsns. These columns can be used to diaplay content in form of grids. The bootstraps grids are responsive. The grid is applied to a "div". The outer "div" should invoke the class "row" to define a row. The inner "div" of "row" will invoke a class "col*-*", meaning size of the display device and the width of the column. For example "col-sm-6", would mean that the coulmn is designed for a tablet and the span of the column is 6 unit columns.<br />The coulmn size should sum equal to 12 all the time. The following code snippet shows the correct way of defining a column.</p>
            <br />
            <code>
                &lt;div class="row"&gt;<br />
                &lt;div class="col-sm-3"&gt;One fourth&lt;/div&gt;<br />
                &lt;div class="col-sm-3"&gt;Half&lt;/div&gt;<br />
                &lt;div class="col-sm-3"&gt;Three Foutrhs&lt;/div&gt;<br />
                &lt;div class="col-sm-3"&gt;Last&lt;/div&gt;<br />
                &lt;/div&gt;
            </code>
            <br />
            <p>The first row on the page that spans 12 unit columns, holds an image which has been embedded using ".img-responsive" class. This class makes the image scale itself nicly when the webpage starts to decrease in size and hence helping in responsive design.</p><br />
